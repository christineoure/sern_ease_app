Megan Monahan is a certified meditation instructor and has studied under Dr. Deepak Chopra. She is also the author of the book, Don't Hate, Meditate. has many benefits, including lowering stress, improving immune function, and slowing mental aging. This age-old practice has become one of the most popular ways to relieve stress among people of all walks of life. Meditation can take many forms and can be combined with many spiritual practices. It can also be used in several important ways Your physical and emotional stress can melt away by learning to . This leaves you feeling better, refreshed, and ready to face the challenges of your day with a healthy attitude. With regular practice over weeks or months, you can experience even greater benefits. Meditation is a practice that incorporates different techniques that help people focus their attention and achieve a heightened state of awareness. It can result in changes in consciousness and has been shown to have a number of health benefits. Meditation involves sitting in a relaxed position and clearing your mind, or focusing your mind on one thought and clearing it of all others. You may focus on a sound, like \"ooommm,\" or on your breathing, counting, a mantra, or nothing at all. A common thread among the many meditation techniques is that the mind stops following every new thought that comes to the surface. It’s generally necessary to have at least five to 20 distraction-free minutes to spend, though meditation sessions can really be any length. Longer meditation sessions tend to bring greater benefits, but it is usually best to start slowly so you can maintain the practice long-term. Hosted by therapist Amy Morin, LCSW, this episode of , featuring 'Good Morning America' anchor Dan Harris, shares a quick step-by-step process for beginners to try meditation. Click below to listen now. Many people find that if they try to meditate for too long each session or create a \"perfect\" practice it can become intimidating or daunting, and they find it more challenging to keep as a daily habit. It is far better to create the habit and work it into a more thorough version of that habit. It’s helpful to have silence and privacy, but more experienced meditators can practice meditation anywhere. Many practitioners of meditation attach a spiritual component to it, but it can also be a secular exercise. Really, there is no wrong way to meditate. One of the main benefits of meditation is its ability to reduce stress. The body's causes the body to automatically react in ways that prepare you to . In some cases of extreme danger, this physical response is helpful. However, a prolonged state of such agitation can cause Meditation affects the body in exactly the opposite way that stress does—by triggering the body's relaxation response. It restores the body to a calm state, helping the body repair itself and preventing new damage from the physical effects of stress. One way that meditation can benefit your mind and body by quieting the stress-induced thoughts that keep your body's stress response triggered. There is an element of more direct physical relaxation involved in meditation as well, obviously, so this double dose of relaxation can really be helpful for shrugging off stress. A greater gain that meditation can bring is the long-term resilience that can come with regular practice. Research has shown that those who practice meditation regularly begin to experience changes in their response to stress that allow them to recover from stressful situations more easily and experience less stress from the challenges they face in their everyday lives. Some of this is thought to be the result of the increase in positive mood that can come from meditation; research shows that those who experience positive moods more often are more resilient toward stress. ﻿ Other research has found changes in the brains of regular meditation practitioners that are linked with a decreased reactivity toward stress. The practice of learning to refocus your thoughts can also help you redirect yourself when you fall into negative thinking patterns, which in itself can help relieve stress. Meditation offers several solutions in one simple activity. The benefits of meditation are great because, among other things, it can reverse your stress response, thereby shielding you from the effects of People who meditate regularly find it easier to give up like smoking, drinking, and drugs. ﻿ They also find it easier to stop rumination from ruining their day.

If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. I've reviewed 55 services to find the best, most affordable online therapy Hannah Owens is a licensed social worker with clinical experience in community mental health, and is the Mental Health Editor for Verywell Mind as well as the Associate Editor for GROUP, the Eastern Group Psychotherapy Society's academic journal. Hannah has worked at Verywell Mind since 2022, and during that time, has overseen extensive testing of 55 different online therapy services and 27 online therapy directories, both for individuals and couples. This gives Hannah expertise in the online therapy field, where she uses the insights gained from over three years of testing to be able to knowledgeably recommend therapy services to a wide variety of therapy seekers. Hannah also uses her clinical experience to act as a subject matter expert for Verywell Mind articles about mental health conditions and services. Online therapy offers you the convenience and privacy of appointments from the comfort of your own home, and it’s usually cheaper and more widely available than in-person therapy. However, as a licensed social worker and former therapist, I can assure you that not all services are created equal. To find the best online therapy services, I’ve spent the last three years researching and extensively testing 55 different companies, racking up hundreds of reviews and thousands of pages of personal insights from testers all across the country. After parsing all this information, I’ve built this online therapy guide, in which I’ll share everything you need to know about all the major online therapy platforms. The services we recommend cost anywhere from $55 per session to over $200. Someone who wants to work through challenges, improve their overall wellbeing, or receive help for a mild or moderate mental health condition. It is for people dealing with serious mental illness or who are in crisis or suicidal. Maybe. Most companies list the insurance plans they accept or let you search for your plan when signing up. I’ve noted the online therapy services on our list that accept insurance. Be sure to read through any company’s privacy policy to better understand whether it is HIPAA-compliant (HIPAA is the law that ) and whether it shares any private information with third parties; we recommend opting out of data collection. You can talk to your therapist via video chat, phone, or text, for anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour or more. That depends on your commitment to doing the hard stuff, the skill of your therapist, and the services offered by the company. For this reason, don't be afraid to switch therapists until you find the right match. Once these elements come together, you’ll be surprised at how effective therapy can be. Here is a breakdown of the online therapy I had 65 different people sign up for talk therapy with all 55 online therapy companies reviewed. Over the past three years, I’ve published 153 reviews (here are our reviews for , for instance). I had my testers try out each company's therapy services, and if the company offered other services (like couples therapy and kid or teen therapy) we tested those too. I asked each tester to try each service for at least a month, which usually meant between two and six sessions at each company. I also asked testers to switch therapists partway through, if possible, in order to get a holistic idea of the offerings and quality of each company. My testers were located all across the United States and abroad, meaning I gained extensive information about each company's services in a variety of areas. I surveyed more than 8,000 therapy clients who are currently using one of the 55 online therapy companies tested or who had used one in the recent past, as well as users of 27 different online therapy directories. I asked users to evaluate each company's services, from their therapist's qualifications to whether they found a therapist who met all their needs to how they'd rate the company overall—all told, I gathered 350 different data points. $69-$109 per week for therapy, billed as a monthly subscription; initial psychiatry evaluation is $299, follow-up psychiatry sessions are $175 each, with bundles available Individual therapy, couples therapy, teen therapy, psychiatry/medication management Wide variety of treatment options, including psychiatry/medication management Can message your therapist anytime Video, phone, or text-based sessions Sessions are only 30 minutes long is the real deal in my book: a one-stop shop for different kinds of therapy with a variety of communication options and psychiatry services as well, all covered by a slew of insurance plans.

In psychodynamic therapy, the client's past experiences are explored and their unconscious thoughts and feelings are brought to light and discussed. By doing this, the client gains insight into the roots of their current behaviors and emotions and how to address and process them moving forward. A psychodynamic therapist will use information gathered from how the client feels towards the therapist and how the therapist feels towards the client to guide the treatment.

The goal is for a trained psychotherapist to help their client tackle specific or general problems such as a particular mental illness or a source of life stress. While a wide range of techniques and strategies can be used, almost all types of psychotherapy involve developing a therapeutic relationship, communicating and creating a dialogue, and working to overcome problematic thoughts or behaviors. Learn more about the options that are available. A psychotherapist focuses on gaining insight into a person's thought processes, and how these may be influenced by past events such that they cause problems in the present. A psychotherapist will work with the client to address the root cause and core issues of current problems so that lasting change and personal growth may occur. While therapy can be used to find solutions across various fields (including physical health, mental health, marriage and family issues), psychotherapy focuses on the management of mental health or emotional issues. Different approaches of psychotherapy may be used depending on the condition being treated, as well as the expertise of the mental health professional. The American Psychological Association classifies these approaches into five broad categories: psychodynamic therapy, behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, humanistic therapy, and integrative therapy. Behavioral therapy is rooted in the principles of , a school of thought focused on the idea that we learn from our environment. Unlike the types of therapy that are rooted in insight (such as ), behavioral therapy is action-based where its goal is to teach people new behaviors to minimize or eliminate the issue. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of behavioral therapy that relies on behavioral techniques, but adds a cognitive element, focusing on the problematic thoughts behind behaviors. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a modified type of (CBT). Its main goals are to teach people how to live in the moment, develop healthy ways to cope with stress, regulate their emotions, and improve their relationships with others. A treatment plan refers to the specific goals you have for therapy and interventions your therapist might use to help you reach these goals. Typically, a treatment plan is created early on in the therapeutic process, and it serves as a guideline to drive your sessions in a way that fits with what you hope to achieve. Counseling is generally used to denote a relatively brief treatment that is focused primarily on behavior. It often targets a particular symptom or problematic situation and offers suggestions and advice for dealing with it. on the other hand is generally a longer-term treatment that focuses more on gaining insight into chronic physical and emotional problems and thought processes.

{"url": "https://www.anxiety.org/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/", "source": "www.anxiety.org", "title": "What is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?", "body": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a complex mental health condition characterised by intrusive, repetitive thoughts that lead to ritualistic behaviours or routines. While some individuals experience only obsessive thoughts or solely compulsive behaviours, the two typically occur together. Those affected often battle with distressing and unwanted ideas, such as fears of contamination, disorder or harm, that drive them to perform certain actions in an attempt to ease their anxiety. It is important to note that being tidy or cautious about hygiene does not equate to having OCD. The condition is defined by obsessions and compulsions that significantly disrupt daily life and functioning. Research suggests that OCD may begin in childhood, with one-third of adults showing symptoms early in life. The average age of diagnosis is around 19. In the United States alone, more than three million individuals are affected annually, with no significant difference in prevalence between men and women. While scientists have not yet identified a single cause, several contributing factors have been linked to OCD, such as: A diagnosis of OCD requires the presence of obsessions or compulsions—or both—that significantly interfere with everyday responsibilities and cause noticeable distress. The individual must also have some awareness that their behaviors or fears are excessive or unreasonable. The symptoms of OCD are generally divided into two main categories: obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are thoughts or images that are persistent, intrusive, and distressing. They are described as “ego-dystonic,” meaning the sufferer recognizes them as their own thoughts but feels powerless to control them. Common obsessive symptoms include: Individuals with OCD often devote at least an hour per day to dealing with such obsessions or related compulsions. Compulsions, on the other hand, are repetitive mental or physical actions carried out to lessen anxiety or neutralize an obsession. These behaviors may provide short-term relief but ultimately reinforce the cycle of distress. Examples include: The intensity of OCD symptoms can fluctuate throughout life and often worsens during periods of stress or fatigue. Effective management of OCD typically involves a combination of therapy and medication. Mental health professionals generally recommend an integrated approach, since medication alone may not address the underlying causes of the disorder. Complementary practices such as mindfulness, meditation and yoga have shown promise in supporting recovery and enhancing resilience. One of the most widely used interventions for OCD is psychotherapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in particular helps individuals to identify the relationship between their thoughts, emotions and actions. Once these patterns are understood, therapists work with patients to replace harmful behaviours and beliefs with healthier coping mechanisms. Another well-established therapeutic technique is exposure therapy, which is also frequently employed. This method involves gradually confronting triggers that provoke anxiety or compulsive responses, thereby reducing their emotional impact over time. For instance, someone with an excessive cleaning compulsion may be encouraged to confront a messy environment without giving in to the urge to clean it. Medication can play a vital role in alleviating the symptoms of OCD, especially when used alongside therapy. The most commonly prescribed drugs include anti-anxiety and antidepressant medications, which target brain chemistry to reduce obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges. Anyone who suspects they may have OCD should consult a qualified healthcare provider to discuss symptoms and explore potential treatment options. Professional guidance ensures that therapy and medication are tailored to the individual’s specific needs, promoting long-term recovery and improved quality of life.

Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania. Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition defined by periods (or episodes) of extreme mood disturbances that affect mood, thoughts, and behavior. There are two main types of bipolar disorders. Bipolar I disorder involves episodes of severe and often depression. Bipolar II disorder involves a less severe form of mania called hypomania. There is also a third type known as Research suggests that around 4.4% of U.S. adults will have bipolar disorder at some point in their lives. Genetics are thought to play a significant role, although brain abnormalities and environmental factors also contribute as causes of bipolar disorder. Mood stabilizers are usually the first-line treatment, but electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be used to address severe symptoms. The exact causes of bipolar disorder are not entirely understood. Research has shown that genetics play a significant role. Other causes include changes in the brain as well as environmental factors including childhood trauma or stress caused by major life changes. Understanding the causes may help scientists develop ways to prevent or treat the condition. Research suggests there is a strong genetic component in bipolar disorder. Twin studies have found that when one identical twin has the condition, the likelihood that their twin sibling will also have it is around 40%. While there is a genetic vulnerability, inherited factors interact with environmental influences that can play a role in triggering the disorder’s onset. Bipolar disorder is typically treated with medications and sometimes electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), therapy, and psychoeducation. Common medications include mood stabilizers or anticonvulsants, as well as second or third generation antipsychotics. Antidepressants are typically avoided if possible due to risks including mania and rapid cycling. Your condition may be considered a disability that is protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or qualifies you for disability payments. If your disability substantially limits your work, you may be able to request reasonable accommodations from your employer. You may qualify for disability benefits if your condition makes it impossible for you to maintain employment. Only a doctor or qualified mental health professional can diagnose you with bipolar disorder. You may want to see your doctor if you are experiencing symptoms of mania, depression, or both. Symptoms of mania can include talking excessively, racing thoughts, decreased sleep, and delusions. Symptoms of depression may include fatigue, prolonged sadness, and loss of interest in activities. This type of bipolar disorder involves the presence of at least one manic episode. Manic episodes may last seven days or longer or be severe enough that a person requires acute care. People usually experience depressive episodes as well, but they may also have mixed episodes where they experience depression and mania at the same time. This type of bipolar disorder is marked by periods of depressive and hypomanic episodes without periods of full-blown mania. It involves at least one episode of depression that lasts at least two weeks and one episode of hypomania that lasts for at least four days. During hypomanic episodes, people have symptoms of mania but are still able to function. This condition, also known as cyclothymia, is marked by periods of cycling between hypomania and depressive symptoms. These symptoms are persistent and  last for at least two years, but they do not meet the criteria to qualify for a diagnosis as a hypomanic or depressive episode. People who have cyclothymic disorder may have a higher risk for later developing bipolar disorder. Mania is a phase of bipolar disorder that involves elevated periods of mood, energy, thoughts, and other behaviors. Common symptoms of mania include rapid and excessive talking, grandiose thoughts and beliefs, decreased sleep, flights of ideas or racing thoughts, an inability to keep still, and trouble concentrating. Hypomania is a symptom of bipolar disorder that involves racing thoughts, impulsive and other out of character behaviors, and elevated moods. It is marked by increased excitability, irritability, and excess energy. People may seem restless, overly talkative, highly distracted, or overly focused on specific activities. A decreased need for sleep, engaging in risky behaviors, and inappropriate social behavior can also be symptoms. Depression is characterized by a persistent low mood and loss of interest in activities that can have a significant impact on a person's ability to function in daily life. Bipolar depression typically presents with increased sleep, increased appetite (often with carbohydrate cravings), and increased rejection sensitivity. Psychotherapy is an approach to the treatment of mental illness that "}

{"url": "https://www.anxiety.org/selective-mutism/", "source": "www.anxiety.org", "title": "Selective Mutism: Symptoms, Causes, Treatment, and Tips for Parents", "body": "Selective mutism (SM) is classified as an anxiety disorder characterised by a child’s consistent inability to speak in certain social situations, such as at school or during sports activities, despite being able to speak comfortably in familiar surroundings, such as at home. Children with SM have normal language skills and often behave in a talkative and expressive way with their immediate family. Yet in public or unfamiliar contexts, they may abruptly ‘shut down’, becoming mute even when they have a lot to say. This condition is not a matter of defiance or lack of knowledge. Instead, children appear to experience a kind of social paralysis, freezing in situations that trigger intense anxiety. Even minor environmental changes, such as a new person entering the room or a change of setting, can provoke silence. A child who chats animatedly with a parent in a restaurant, for example, may fall silent the moment a waiter approaches or another child joins the table. This selective silence can be deeply distressing for families, as it interferes with a child’s ability to ask for help, participate in learning and connect with others in daily life. It is natural for young children to vary how much they speak, particularly in new environments or when meeting unfamiliar people. Occasional silence is a normal part of social development and usually disappears as a child becomes more familiar with their surroundings. However, selective mutism differs significantly from this typical pattern. Children with SM persistently refrain from speaking in situations where speech is expected, such as in classrooms, even after prolonged exposure or familiarity. Their silence can last for months or even years, resulting in tangible consequences for their academic, emotional and social functioning. Because SM is relatively uncommon, adults often misinterpret the behavior as extreme shyness or stubbornness. Teachers and caregivers may assume the child will “grow out of it,” overlooking the underlying anxiety. Shyness, however, is generally transient and situation-specific. A shy child may be quiet at a new school or party but gradually begins speaking as they become comfortable. In contrast, a child with SM often remains silent despite repeated exposure and positive interactions. Even after years with the same peers or teachers, they may still struggle to answer simple questions like their name or age. This ongoing inability to communicate can interfere with basic needs—such as asking to use the restroom or seeking help when hurt. It is crucial to understand that children with Selective Mutism are not being oppositional or rude. Their silence stems from a deep-rooted fear of social judgment or embarrassment. Many worry about saying something “wrong” or not being liked, which triggers overwhelming anxiety. Without proper identification and treatment, these children risk developing additional mental health issues, such as social anxiety disorder, depression, or persistent SM into adolescence and adulthood. Left unaddressed, the condition can significantly hinder emotional, social, and academic development, often leaving families feeling powerless against the persistent cycle of silence. Selective mutism (SM) is often perceived as rare, but it affects around 1% of the general population (APA, 2013; Bergman, 2012). This rate is comparable to, and in some cases even higher than, the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders. Despite its relatively early onset, selective mutism often goes unrecognised for several years, delaying diagnosis and treatment. The first signs of SM typically emerge between the ages of two and a half and four, when children begin to interact more frequently with people outside their immediate family. However, formal identification of the disorder usually does not occur until around the ages of 5 or 6, often coinciding with the transition into school life (Kotrba, 2015). The average age at which a professional assessment is conducted and treatment begins tends to be between 6½ and 9 years old, corresponding to approximately four years of school attendance (Kotrba, 2015). This delay between symptom onset and intervention can reinforce patterns of silence and make it more difficult for children to regain confidence in speaking. Gender differences have also been observed. Studies indicate that SM occurs more frequently among girls than boys, at a ratio of almost 2:1 (Kumpulainen, 2002; García, 2004). The reason for this disparity remains unclear. It may reflect genuine differences in prevalence, or it may be influenced by social expectations that girls should be more verbally expressive, leading adults to notice and report their silence more readily. Without timely intervention, the tendency to remain silent in specific situations can become deeply ingrained. Children may internalise the identity of being ‘the one who doesn’t talk’, which can reinforce both social withdrawal and anxiety. As these patterns persist, the cons"}

Clinically significant depression is marked by persistent sadness, a depressed mood, diminished interest in previously enjoyable activities, and other symptoms that interfere with the ability to function in daily life. The condition often arises from a complex combination of factors that can include genetics, family history, trauma, stress, and illness. It is one of the most common mental disorders as nearly 1 in 5 adults in the United States have been diagnosed with depression in their lifetime. Fortunately, effective treatments are available including medications, psychotherapy, or a combination of the two. Self-help strategies can also help people better cope with their symptoms and begin to feel better. Appropriate treatment for depression is essential, but self-help strategies can also help you feel better. Some things that can help you cope with feelings of depression include getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, finding social support, and engaging in regular physical activity. While depression can make these things more challenging, tackling one or two tasks each day can help improve your well-being. Some ways that you can support a friend or loved one with depression include offering support and avoiding judgment. Offer to help with tasks that your friend might be struggling with. Let them know you care, ask them what you can do to help, and encourage them to talk to their doctor. Learn more about depression so you can better understand ways you can help. While depression appears to have some genetic risk factors, there is no identifiable gene for depression. However, research suggests that it is the interaction of genetics and environmental factors that contribute to the condition’s onset. You may have a genetic predisposition to depression, but this does not necessarily mean that you will develop the condition. While there is no “cure” for depression, it is a treatable condition that can often be alleviated with the use of medications, psychotherapy, and lifestyle modifications. Antidepressants can be effective, but they often take some time to begin working. While such medications may be used alone, they are also often prescribed in conjunction with psychotherapy. A mood disorder refers to a broad class of mental health conditions, including depression and bipolar disorder, that primarily impact emotional states. People may experience prolonged periods of a significantly depressed or sad mood, or they may have episodes of an abnormally elevated or irritable mood to an extent that it causes distress and interferes with daily living. A psychiatric evaluation is an assessment utilized by psychiatrists to diagnose mental health conditions. An evaluation often involves talking to your doctor about your symptoms, getting a physical exam, and filling out a questionnaire. This allows your doctor to gain insight into the nature and severity of your condition. Persistent depressive disorder (PDD), previously known as dysthymia, is a chronic state of depression. It involves symptoms such as low mood, loss of interest, sleep changes, and appetite changes that last for at least two years. Symptoms may vary in intensity over time. Psychosis is a mental state that involves losing contact with reality. People who experience psychosis may believe, see, hear, or feel things that are not real. Psychotic depression is a condition in which people experience psychotic symptoms such delusions and hallucinations alongside symptoms of depression. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), formally known as major depressive disorder with a seasonal pattern, is a mood disorder that occurs the same time each year. People may experience feelings of depression, social withdrawal, and fatigue usually during the fall and winter. Disruptions to the normal circadian rhythm, often associated with reduced sunlight, may contribute to the condition’s onset. Postpartum depression, formally known as major depressive disorder with a peripartum onset, is a serious but treatable form of depression that generally occurs after giving birth. It can potentially present with psychotic features and is characterized by symptoms such as sadness, fatigue, poor sleep, trouble bonding with the baby, feelings of guilt, and intrusive thoughts.
